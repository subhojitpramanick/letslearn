One company wanted full exclusivity, while the other was unwilling to agree. The mediator, David, proposed a creative solution. He suggested a phased exclusivity model. For the first year, the partnership would be exclusive. If both parties met their performance targets in that year, the exclusivity would be extended. If not, the clause would be renegotiated. This compromise allowed both sides to mitigate their risks while still committing to the partnership's success. Both parties agreed, and the deal was signed.",
